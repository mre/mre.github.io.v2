I wrote about the [future of Rust before](/future-of-rust) before and it seems like nobody's keeps me from doing it again. Quite the contrary: this time the Rust core team even [asked for it](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html).
So here's my 2 cents about the priorities for Rust in 2018.

## How I Roll

There's a depressingly big chance that you've never heard of me.
I've been using Rust since before 1.0. It was the first language that allowed me to write "real" low-level code without feeling like [arguing with a bouncer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uurT7yVWkQ). 
I contribute here and there but mostly I use Rust for private projects and internal tooling at trivago.



## Rusty Requests

So here's my wishlist for 2018 in no particular order.

### Compiler documentation for easier contribution

When I was in Columbus, Ohio for [Rust Belt Rust](https://www.rust-belt-rust.com/), I met [Niko Matsakis](https://twitter.com/nikomatsakis), [Ariel Ben-Yehuda](https://github.com/arielb1) and [Santiago Pastorino](https://twitter.com/spastorino).
Those fine gentlemen eagerly worked on Non-lexical-lifetimes during the impl-period.
Watching them hack away on the compiler was deeply inspirational to a point where I wanted to contribute, too.
Needless to say, the barrier to entry for hacking on the compiler can be quite high.
I didn't achieve to contribute anything yet. One thing I'd love to do is invest short 30-60 minutes chunks of time into creating a pull request. Could be as simple as renaming a variable, writing a test or adding some documentation.
Hence my first wish is, that contributing the language will become easier.
That could be achieved with accessible mentorship, more `easy` tickets and [better compiler documentation]().
All of that was already [suggested by Niko](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/01/05/lessons-from-the-impl-period/).

More resources for intermediate programming (see https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-2018/)
Crates io namespaces like composer: mre/error. It gets harder to come up with good names
Impl trait
Stabilize ? In main (+example)
Stabilize generators
Key value aeguments
Variadric functions
Better Concurrency story
Futures tokio is too difficult for me. No docs
More easy bugs. Contributing to libz blitz was very hard for me
Tool like goreleaser
Obvious: stabilize more crates
RFC documentation overview hard to keep overview
Error messages
Compile times
Non-lexical-lifetimes (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45538/files)
