What makes a great public speaker? He's passionate, knowledgeable, and a good storyteller. I strive to become better at all of that.
Here are some of my recent presentations.

Rust is more than a Systems Programming language; it's a new way of thinking about low-level code.
It has strong safety and concurrency guarantees without sacrificing performance.
It provides powerful abstractions that make Systems Programming both, easier and more fun. 
Let me show you what's in for you and why you should learn Rust, even though you might be a Web-Developer.

<h2>What's so hard about writing a Slack Client in Rust?</h2>
<img src="/img/talks/slack-client.jpg" />
<ul>
<li class="talk_location">Rust Usergroup Cologne, March 2017</li>

</ul>
"I'll just write a simple API wrapper for that. Give me two hours." Does that sound oddly familiar? Don't be fooled: writing an easy to use, idiomatic abstraction layer is a lot of work - in any language. I want to tell you my story about writing a Slack client in Rust. From documentation to testing and error handling there's a lot of pitfalls to avoid and laughs to share.

<h2>Why Rust?</h2>
<img src="/img/talks/why-rust.jpg" />
<ul>
<li class="talk_location">Codemotion Amsterdam, May 2016</li>
<li class="talk_video"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imtejBNbm0o">Video</a></li>
<li class="talk_slides"><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mre/why-rust">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
Rust is the new kid on the block. It's a system programming language that is blazingly fast and offers powerful high-level abstractions better known from dynamic languages like Ruby or Python. Rust offers memory safety without a Garbage Collector and makes low-level programming easier and more secure. I will give an introductory talk about Rust and show some of its nicest features.

What tools are available for Rust development?
This talk gives you an overview of ways to help you write better Rust code.

<h2>The State of PyPy</h2>
<img src="/img/talks/pypy.jpg" />
<ul>
  <li class="talk_location">Python Usergroup D&uuml;sseldorf, April 2015</li>
  <li class="talk_video"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEzuUJGcPqc">Video</a></li>
  <li class="talk_slides"><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mre/the-state-of-pypy-april-2015">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
PyPy is a relatively new implementation of Python with a focus on performance. In this talk I give an overview of PyPy and how it works internally. Also I talk a bit about PyPy STM, a new approach for parallel code execution that can take advantage of modern multi-core hardware.
