Zero-Copy Unix cat Command for Linux and macOS using splice and copyfile

In a previous post, I analyzed the performance of one of the most simple Unix commands: `yes`.
I got a lot of valuable feedback.
Today we want to look another classic Unix command by analyzing `cat`.

## How is `cat` so fast?

```ruby
#!/usr/local/bin/ruby

def cat(args)
  args.each{|arg|
		unless File.exists?(arg)
			puts "#{arg}: No such file or directory"
			next
		end
		IO.foreach(arg){|line|
			puts line
		}
	}
end
cat(ARGV)
```


```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate error_chain;

use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, BufReader, Read, Write};

pub const BUFFER_CAPACITY: usize = 64 * 1024;

error_chain! {
    foreign_links {
        Io(std::io::Error);
    }
}

fn run() -> Result<()> {
    let path = env::args().nth(1).unwrap();

    let stdout = io::stdout();
    let mut locked = stdout.lock();
    let mut buffer = [0u8; BUFFER_CAPACITY];

    let input = File::open(path)?;
    let mut buffered = BufReader::new(input);

    loop {
        let bytes_read = buffered.read(&mut buffer)?;
        if bytes_read == 0 {
            break;
        }
        locked.write_all(&buffer)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}

quick_main!(run);
```




I was inspired by http://blog.superpat.com/2010/06/01/zero-copy-in-linux-with-sendfile-and-splice/
which offers a link to a nice summary by Linus Torvalds from 2006 (https://web.archive.org/web/20130305002825/http://kerneltrap.org/node/6505)

Manpage: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html

> **splice()** moves data between two file descriptors without copying
> between kernel address space and user address space.  It transfers up
> to len bytes of data from the file descriptor fd_in to the file
> descriptor fd_out, where one of the file descriptors must refer to a
> pipe.

Kernel Sourcecode
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/6ed0529fef09f50ef41d396cb55c5519e4936b16/fs/splice.c

Somewhat resembles a splice implementation
https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/blob/5851bd075feeb314ddfafa56853f51b3da0a2fb2/test/test_fcntl.rs#L64


C implementation:
http://www.sourcexr.com/articles/2014/02/23/avoid-data-copy-with-splice

```C
#include <fcntl.h>

ssize_t splice (int fd_in, loff_t *off_in, int fd_out,
                loff_t *off_out, size_t len,
                unsigned int flags);
```

```C
const ssize_t r = splice (src, NULL, dst, NULL, size, 0);
```


The Rust implementation looks a bit scary, but it's actually easier to use:

```rust
#[cfg(any(target_os = "linux", target_os = "android"))]
pub fn splice(fd_in: RawFd, off_in: Option<&mut libc::loff_t>,
              fd_out: RawFd, off_out: Option<&mut libc::loff_t>,
              len: usize, flags: SpliceFFlags) -> Result<usize>
```

Copyfile signature
```C
#include <copyfile.h>

int copyfile(const char *from, const char *to, copyfile_state_t state, copyfile_flags_t flags);
```

On my laptop, printing the [complete works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) takes a third of a second.

So I needed a **big** file for the benchmark.
Like, the biggest file I could get.
How about `cat`ing my entire harddisk?

```
sudo ./cat.rb /dev/disk0 | pipebench -q > /dev/null
Piped    1.09 GB in 00h00m09.54s:  117.57 MB/second
```

```
sudo cat /dev/disk0 | pipebench -q > /dev/null
Piped    1.37 GB in 00h00m10.09s:  139.22 MB/second
```
