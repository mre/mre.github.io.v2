tl;dr: Rust is a safe systems-programming language. But besides its guaranteed safety, it also rivals C/C++ in speed for some datasets.
Let me show you the tricks that Rust make Rust fast, which are possible but very hard to pull off in other languages.
I will talk about agressive compile-time optimizations, zero-cost abstractions, fearless concurrency, and more.
Concrete examples come from tools like ripgrep, serde, tokio and diesel.
