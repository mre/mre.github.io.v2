# Why the hate?

You're not a worse programmer for using PHP.

It's okay to use MongoDB.  
Node.js, SVN, Perl and Visual Basic are fine, too.

In our industry, many engineers have an incredible hubris.  
They look down on hobbyists, self-taught programmers and people that come out of code bootcamps.
And by doing that, they create a toxic environment; it's unbearable.

No matter what they say: you can do this! We need more people like you in our industry.
Focus on building awesome products and resist the temptation to bash on technologies.

As long as you feel productive and happy, don't listen to nay-sayers.
