All too often we use terminology without knowing the origin.
I find it fascinating to read about the etymology of computer terms. Here are some of my
highlights.

## Bug

One of the most well-known ones. It's actually not from a bug that Grace Hopper
found in her machine. It dates back much longer than that.

## Patch

Bugs are fixed with patches.

## Floppy disk
(a 3d-printed save icon)

## Firmware

Between hardware and software.

## i18n

Number of letters between the i and the n.
Same for kubernetes (k8s) and localization (l10n)

## bikeshed

## Boilerplate

## Uppercase and lowercase

## Ship it

## Foo & Bar

When a programmer quickly needs a placeholder variable name, he sometimes uses
"foo" or "bar". These terms come from military.

There's a much longer list on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_term_etymologies)
